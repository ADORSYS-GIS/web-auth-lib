- Organize code by feature/domain rather than by technical role
- Maintain a clear separation between UI components and business logic
- Use barrel files (index.ts) for cleaner imports
- Keep component files focused on single responsibility
- Structure directories to minimize import complexity (avoid deeply nested imports)
- Shared components should reside in a dedicated directory
- Environment-specific configuration should be externalized
- Define clear boundaries between application layers
- Keep related files close to each other
