- Commit messages should follow conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Pull requests should include clear descriptions and be of manageable size
- Suggest creating focused feature branches with descriptive names
- Always run tests locally before pushing code
- Document breaking changes clearly in changelogs and version updates
- Peer reviews should focus on business logic, performance, and maintainability
- Use feature flags for deploying work-in-progress features
- Keep internationalization in mind from the beginning
- Suggest automatic issue linking in commits and PRs
