- All TypeScript/JavaScript code should be formatted using Prettier and ESLint with appropriate configs
- Always suggest TypeScript over JavaScript for new projects and features
- Use modern ES6+ syntax (arrow functions, destructuring, etc.) consistently
- Follow naming conventions: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/classes, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Organize imports in groups: external libraries first, followed by internal modules, then relative imports
- Avoid any/unknown types in TypeScript when possible, suggest proper type definitions
- Prefer functional components over class components in React
- Encourage use of optional chaining and nullish coalescing operators
- Suggest typing for all function parameters and return values
