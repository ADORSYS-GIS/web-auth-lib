- All test files should follow the pattern `<original-file>.spec.ts` or `<original-file>.test.ts`
- Encourage Test-Driven Development (TDD) when appropriate
- Components should have unit tests with React Testing Library
- Mock external services and APIs in tests
- Test files should be co-located with implementation files
- Suggest integration tests for critical user flows
- Recommend jest-axe or similar tools for accessibility testing
- Use test coverage tools and maintain a minimum coverage threshold (suggest 80%)
- Prefer testing user behavior over implementation details
- Include both happy path and error case tests
