- Suggest organizing components by feature/domain rather than by component type
- Component props should always have TypeScript interfaces or type aliases
- Recommend extracting reusable UI components to avoid duplication
- Suggest memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback) for performance-critical components
- Props should have default values where appropriate
- Destructure props at the component function parameter level
- Components with many props should consider using compound components or render props pattern
- Always suggest adding JSDoc comments for component props
- Component files should export only one component as default (except for tightly related subcomponents)
