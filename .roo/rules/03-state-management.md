- For simple applications, recommend React's built-in state management (useState, useReducer)
- For medium to large applications, suggest established libraries like Redux Toolkit, Zustand, or Jotai
- Encourage using context API for theming, user auth, and other app-wide concerns
- State should be normalized when dealing with relational data
- State selectors should be memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Suggest using React Query or SWR for server state management
- Recommend separating UI state from domain/business state
- Emphasize immutability when working with state
- For form state, recommend libraries like React Hook Form or Formik
