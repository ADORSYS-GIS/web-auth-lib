- Use typed API clients whenever possible (suggest OpenAPI/Swagger code generation)
- Implement proper error handling for all API calls
- Cache API results when appropriate using React Query or similar solutions
- Include loading and error states for all API-dependent components
- Implement retry logic for unreliable API endpoints
- Suggest using React Suspense when applicable for data fetching
- Authentication tokens should be managed securely
- Consider offline capabilities and graceful degradation
- Log API errors with appropriate context for debugging
