# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

# Using Changeset in the Web Auth Libraries Monorepo

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versioning and publishing of all packages in the monorepo. This ensures that internal dependencies are correctly versioned and that consumers of the libraries receive the correct versions from npm.

## Workflow for Making Changes

1. **Make your code changes** in the relevant package(s) under `packages/`.
2. **Add a changeset** by running:
   ```sh
   yarn changeset
   ```
   - Follow the prompts to select the affected packages and describe the change (major, minor, patch).
   - This will create a markdown file in `.changeset/` describing the change.
3. **Commit your changes** including the changeset file.
4. **Open a Pull Request**. The CI will check the changeset and build the packages.
5. **Versioning and Publishing**:
   - When changes are merged to `main`, the CI will run `yarn changeset version` and `yarn changeset publish`.
   - This will update the versions in all affected `package.json` files and publish the packages to npm.
   - Internal `workspace:^` dependencies will be replaced with the correct published version numbers.

## Best Practices

- Always add a changeset for any change that affects a published package.
- Never publish packages manually; always use the automated workflow.
- Do not add changesets for the example app (`web-auth-example`).
- Use clear and descriptive summaries in your changesets.
